Crosseyes is a project that focuses on detecting crosswalks using a raspberry pi with an attached webcam. Alerts are sent when crosswalks are detected with sensors that are attached to the pi extension GrovePi+. crosseyes.py and signeyes.py are python programs that run crosswalk and sign detection (crosswalk signs and stop signs) respectively.
